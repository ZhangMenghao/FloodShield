Flow-Watcher: A DoS Attack Defense Extension for the Infrastructure of Software-Defined Networks
====================================

A brief introduction
---------------

Software-Defined Networking(SDN) has attracted great attention from both academia and industry. As the *de facto* standard of SDN, [OpenFlow](https://www.opennetworking.org/en/sdn-resources/openflow) introduces a reactive mechanism for packet processing, that is, the controller computes and installs new flow rules when a switch makes a packet-in request asking for adctions, OpenFlow switches only process packets based on the flow tables generated by the controller.

This reactive packet processing mechanism enables SDN to quickly adapt to network dynamcis, however, it may also become a new vulnerabilit when numerous packet-in messages are issued from the data plane. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability of SDN to enforce *data-to-control plane saturation attack*, a dedicated *Denial-of-Service(DoS) Attack* against the SDN infrastructure. By controlling a number of bot hosts, the attacker could generate a lager number of malicious packets with forged header values. These malicious packets will trigger a great number of *table-misses* and packet-in messages, which would exhaust the available resources of the SDN infrastructure.

To address this problem, we propose **Flow-Watcher** framework, a SDN defense framework against data-to-control plane saturation attack. By combining **source address validation** and **stateful packet supervision**, Flow-watcher provides comprehensive protection for the resources of the SDN infrastructure. Flow-Wacher can be implemented as *applications* on the existing SDN network operation systems(e.g. [Floodlight](https://github.com/floodlight/floodlight), [OpenDayLight](https://www.opendaylight.org/), [ONOS](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos)). It introduces **Source Address Validation** App and **Stateful Packet Supervision** App to the controller platform, as shown in the follwing fig. *Source Address Validation* App works when network starts up and constitutes the first barrier to data-to-control plane saturation attack. Based on it, *Stateful Packet Supervision* App supervises the packet states of each real address and performs suppression according to the statistics and network resource usage.

Implementations and experiments demonstrate that Flow-Watcher provides effective protection for all three components of SDN infrastructure with little overhead.
